        <b><h1>Welcome to Village Folk by Andrea Durnell</h1></b>

        <p>Village Folk is inspired by a nostalgia for the past, a respect for artisans and a love of travel.
            I take pride in making useful, creative and eclectic wares that make people smile.  If I can do so
            while preserving something vintage and using time worn methods, so much the better. Everything in
            my shop is something I personally have made. I love the flaws and imperfections that occur when making
            things by hand and I am completely incapable of mass producing anything I do. Rest assured, the things
            you buy from me are one of a kind! </p>

        <p>I have had the good fortune to live in and travel to many countries. I try to express the lasting joy
            and wonder generated by my experiences “off the beaten path” by using colors and styles inspired by
            life in North and West Africa, Europe and Guatemala. I’m nostalgic about the past and show it by
            incorporating vintage treasures I have found along the way.  Small villages, local people, open markets,
            artisanal and folk crafts all captivate me, thus my shop name, Village Folk. </p>

        <p>I love rich, vibrant hues and the warmth and textures of natural fibers. I hate throwing things out and
            strive to find a way to give old things new life.  The Village Folk dolls and their use of worn, vintage
            textiles for their clothing and shoes reflect this.   My hats do so because I use vintage wooden hat molds
            as a basis for my shapes and scour antique shops for styles I wish to bring back to life. </p>

        <p>I began sculpting, carving and making dolls as a young girl. When my mom’s house was in Country Living Magazine
            (1988, Mar, pp ),a photo of dolls I had made the clothes for was pictured and generated more buzz for dolls than
            my mom, who is an oil painter, wanted to spend time on.  The dolls have evolved over the years into an expression
            of my own personality as I have learned to carve more skillfully and to anthropomorphize. I like my dolls to look
            like they have a story to tell, and some of them actually do. I have found fabrics and trims in flea markets in
            Paris, the souks in Tunis, open markets of Togo, antique shops in Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and points in between.
            I pay a lot of attention to faces and often am reminded of these people and their places as a carved head takes its
            shape and is painted.  The dolls are often named in a way that takes me back to these moments in time. </p>

        <p>Wool felting is a more recent (since 2000) enjoyment.  It is very colorful, tactile, sculptural, almost immediately
            gratifying and limitless. It is also an ancient technique worth learning, preserving and adapting to current fashion
            trends. The first hat mold I bought was intended as a piece of folk art for my studio, but like all folk art, its
            function is part of its beauty and I couldn’t help but use it. I love thinking about these wonderful wooden sculptures,
            how they were made, and who made them and imagining a connection between the original milliners and myself, with these
            tools of the trade as a wormhole in time. </p>

        <p>Some of my work is always in my shop on etsy (www.etsy.com/shop/VillageFolk) and other work can only be seen at trade
            shows. Follow me on Facebook (www.facebook.com/VillageFolkByAndreaDurnell) to see my latest creations and to find
            out where you can find me in person. I generally stick to fall shows and spend the rest of the year making hats,
            scarves, pins and carving dolls while enjoying my garden, baking bread and picking through antique shops for inspiration
            and tools. </p>
